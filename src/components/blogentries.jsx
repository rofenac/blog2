    title: 'Module 3 Journal Entry - Qubit for Your Thoughts',
    date: '25 Apr 2025',
    content: `One may ask, how did I choose QAI as a research topic? I've been interested in technology, particularly computing since early childhood. That interest has grown until present day where the world stands at a pivotal moment where two powerful nascent technologies, quantum computing and AI, will soon merge. You thought ChatGPT was a disruptive technology? Just wait. Most of the sources I have rejected so far have mostly been articles that talk about one field or the other, and only lightly touch on their convergence. There just wasn't enough information about the two technologies together to use in my project. Other than that, source collection continues.`

    title: 'Module 3 Progress Report - The Grind is Real',
    date: '25 Apr 2025',
    content: `My plan for having a rough draft done by week nine of the quarter involves using another week or two to process my sources. Then I will write an outline for the paper. After that I will begin the rough draft. I believe this will keep me on track for the week nine goal of a finished rough draft. With that said, I believe I am still on track and have no significant blockers. I'm still processing my sources, and there are a lot of them. Next week I MIGHT be done processing and could feasibly start writing the outline.`

    title: 'Module 2 Journal Entry - Mind the (Knowledge) Gap',
    date: '18 Apr 2025',
    content: `I am swimming in an ocean of new terms and ideas. As a non-mathmetician and a non-computer scientist, I am struggling to understand the jargon of both quantum computing and AI. One way to mitigate this is by categorizing my sources. Most of them are scholarly journal articles and white papers. I have not yet made it to the OC Library as of this writing, but I will make it there soon. While I am searching my primary search keywords are mainly, 'quantum computing', 'artificial intelligence', and 'quantum AI'. There are other terms that help drill down like, 'Majorana 1', 'qubit', and even a little 'quantum theory'. Oh and quasi-particles are another branch of research that I have unearthed. My head is spinning but I will get through it all. I would try to explain all of these new terms but I still don't understand them very well. On a high level, Majorana 1 is the quantum technology that was announced in February 2025 which is touted as the world's first Quantum Processing Unit (QPU). It levrages something called a topological core architecture. And it just gets wilder from there. Quasi-particles are particles that act as one type of particle. Confused yet? It's like a gestalt system where several particles act as one system. That's probably a terrible definition but that's how I understand it at this point. As one can see, my knowledge gaps involving these two fields are vast. The grind continues.`

    title: 'Module 2 Progress Report - Subject Solidified',
    date: '18 Apr 2025',
    content: `I have firmly settled on quantum AI (QAI) as my research topic. I am also toying with the idea of possibly predicting, based on my sources, where QAI might be in 1, 5, 10, and 20 years. It's an ambitious goal, and I may have to abandon it, but for now that's my crazy idea for the week. With that said, my research methods remain unchanged. Library, journals, LLMs will all be utilized for the project. I believe I am where I need to be this week. I am still gathering and evaluating sources, which is somewhat laborious, but it's part of the process. Still no real blockers, except the volume of sources. Next week I expect to possibly start writing an outline for the research paper itself. It will definitely be a first draft, likely to be revised multiple times. Iteration can be a powerful tool.`

    title: 'Lab Activity, Week Two - Searching and Organizing',
    date: '16 Apr 2025',
    content: `This week's lab dealt with research techniques and how to keep track of your sources. For now, I am using NotebookLM to keep track. Some of the advantages of NotebookLM is that not only does it keep track of what documents I have evaluated, but it also reads those sources and I can ask questions about them and NLM will answer. It's a powerful tool. NLM is probably my favorite AI tool as of this writing. I don't have a favorite source so far. I have over 90 sources I am weeding through and nothing stands out yet. Later on I might give Zotero a try since that seems very useful as well, especially when creating citations.`

    title: 'Module 1 Journal Entry - A New Journey Begins',
    date: '12 Apr 2025',
    content: `As I mentioned in this week's progress report, I believe I will be doing my research project on Quantum AI (QAI). This is the the merging of two relatively nascent fields, quantum computing and artificial intelligence. I believe utilizing the OC library, LLMs, scholarly journals and even white papers will be the most efficacious way to collect sources. This isn't my first research project, but it is definitely the first time doing one of this scale and scope. I find research fun, particularly when it is a field that I am personally interested in. QAI is such a field. I feel that QAI will be a major step towards developing artificial general intelligence, (AGI), and by extension, artificial super intelligence, (ASI). In the past, I have usually started my research at a library, which I plan to do this time, but LLMs are useful enough now that I can use them to help me start gathering resources. To end off, one thing I learned this week is the existence of a qubit, the basis of quantum computing.`

    title: 'Module 1 Progress Report - Quantum AI',
    date: '12 Apr 2025',
    content: `It's taken me a little while to get in gear this quarter, but I'm catching up. I have been looking around for ideas for a research project, and I think I want to do something related to the coming merger of AI and quantum computing. At this point, I feel like I am where I need to be in this journey, which is cementing an idea and starting to collect sources. So far I have no blockers. Well I say that, but perhaps a block could be having too many sources to sift through. But overall good progress this week. Next week I plan to continue to gather sources and start to evaluate them for applicability to my project.`
